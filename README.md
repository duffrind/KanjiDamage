# KanjiDamage
These are the scripts and produced html files from downloading KanjiDamage and then making it app friendly to then process with PhoneGap.

I used SiteSucker to download the website and then made my own Python scripts to convert it into PhoneGap friendly files.

Features:

* Bookmarking: Pressing on the KANJIDAMAGE header will bookmark your current Kanji or Radical. Clicking on this header while not on a Kanji or Radical page will load your latest bookmark.
* No Ads: I removed most of the ads and tracking. I will remove more when I have time.
* Offline: The app does not need internet access.

Current Issues:

* No Icons
* Unsigned Code

Android Version: /apps/init-debug.apk
iOS Version: /apps/KanjiDamage.app
