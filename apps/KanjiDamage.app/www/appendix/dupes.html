<div class='container'><p> You may have noticed when using your &quot;electronic dictionary&quot; that 
  sometimes you'll enter a word and 2 or even 3 kanji pop up. And you wonder, 
  &quot;Which am I supposed to use?&quot; You have run smack-dab into one of these 
  Only In Nihongo boondoggles: SYNONYMS WHICH ARE ALSO HOMONYMS! As far as I know, 
  there is nowhere - no book, no website - that has listed and dealt with this 
  category of words. So. Which do you use? </p>
<p>Here, I try to answwer this question in two ways. First, I'm putting a big &quot;$$$&quot; next to the most useful one, the one with the broadest meaning, so you know which one to use when writing. Second, I'll explain the different nuances of each, so if you're reading Japanese, you'll be able to extract the precise meaning. </p>
<p>Keep in mind that t hese nuances and &quot;how often is it used&quot; percentages only apply to this particular kunyomi of the kanji - not to its other kunyomi or jukugo. </p>
